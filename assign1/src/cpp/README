Sorry for my poor planning. This assignment turns out to be much more difficult than I thought, thus the late submission.

I tried to use a modula design, so later assignments can use the cfg I generated today easily. I haven't touch objective-oriented programming for years, I used some container(map and set) in C++ STL as suggested by lab handout, and they give me a relatively much eaiser life. 

All code used to generate Dominator is copied from handout.
