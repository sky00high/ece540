In this assignment, I took advantage of my old class's modulazation and implemented this assignemnt rather easily.

I created a new class called BitVector for the easy of set operations.

Because my old code doesn't handle ret correctly, so I will faile test 11. I don't have enough time to fix this but willdo next time.

Cheers!!
